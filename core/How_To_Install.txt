Installation:
-------------

# Use a *modern* Browser!
# You need PHP 5 with PDO-support and access to a MySQL-database.
# Start your Browser and go to your Kimai directory.
# Since 0.8 Kimai has a step-by-step installation program. 
  Just follow the instructions of the installer.

IMPORTANT! Remove the 'installer' directory when youâ€™ve successfully
installed Kimai.

  ***********************************************
  * You can login via the preinstalled account: *
  * User: admin / Password: changeme            *
  ***********************************************

When Kimai doesn't start the reason is probably wrong writing permissions
of certain files and folders! The installer shows you which permissions
are to be set.

If you have problems installing, please read the section 'Support'
in the forum. -> http://forum.kimai.org

A new version updates the database automatically (is nessesary).
Before that a backup of your data will be created. Normally you'll
not even notice this process. If anything goes wrong during the
database-update you can recover the data via phpMyAdmin (we're
also working on a tool for recoverage...)


Updates:
--------

YOU CAN ONLY UPDATE VERSIONS HIGHER THAN 7.0!

There are two new variables to set in the conf.php if you did not
install via the step-by-step installer:

$server_type = 'mysql';	  // the database type (needed for PDO) usually 'mysql'
						  // check the PHP PDO manual if you are using a different
						  // database
$server_conn = "mysql";

The installation will then be performed in non-PDO mode. If you want to
use PDO $server_conn must be set to "pdo".

To install a new version just replace the entire directory with the new
package except the file 'conf.php' which sits insite the 'includes' folder.
Additionally you have to set the writing permissions of the directory 'compile' 
so that PHP can write to it. Additionally you need to make all 'compile' folders 
(also inside all extension subfolders!). Writing permission must also be granted
to the 'temporary' folder and the included 'logfile.txt'.

For coming versions (>0.8.0) you need to keep the file 'autoconf.php' if you
installed Kimai via the UI-Installer (not by editing the 'conf.php').

Once again: Kimai will NOT work with wrong writing permissions!


CAUTION:
--------

This software is free of charge. That doesn't mean, that you are allowed to
remove copyright-notes. Neither on the login-panel nor in the cretits-window.
Of course you're not allowed to remove the link to the credits... If those
notes are bothing you and you do not agree with this rules - DON'T use
Kimai. 



Installation via conf.php
-------------------------

Hint: This is the *old* way to install Kimai. You *can* install this way,
but it is recommended to install via the step-by-step installer.

# Enter database name, server, host, etc. into the /includes/conf.php file.

# Make sure that the 'temporary' directory and the contained 'logfile.txt' are
  writable for PHP.
  
# Make sure that the 'compile' directory is writable for PHP. Also proceed this
  way with the 'compile' directories of all extensions. You find a shell-script
  which performs this tasks under Unix and Linux systems.

# Call up the Kimai directory in your browser
  (the database tables are generated automatically then)
  
# The 'includes' folder should be protected from external access. On Apache
  servers you achieve this with the delivered .htaccess file (make sure
  your FTP-client transfers invisible files).
  
# Setup ready!

You can set more options in the file 'includes/vars.php' such as the date-format
for example. By default Kimai displays dates like "day.month.year". You can
easily change that into "month-day-year" ... You find more instructions
directly in the vars.php file.

SQL for database creation: 
CREATE DATABASE `kimai` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;

Have Fun!
